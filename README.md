# ProfanityGuard
Welcome to ProfanityGuard, a simple yet effective C++ program designed for filtering out undesirable language. This project was made to practice my programming skills in the hope of mastering strings in C++. ProfanityGuard serves as a simple, bad word filter, capable not only of detecting explicit swear words but also of identifying words that closely resemble profanities without being explicit themselves.

# Key Features

    Swear Word Detection: ProfanityGuard employs a robust algorithm to identify and filter out explicit swear words, ensuring a more respectful and user-friendly environment.

    Similarity Avoidance: Going beyond the basics, the filter intelligently avoids flagging words that may look or sound like profanities but aren't offensive. This enhances the accuracy of the filter, reducing false positives and creating a more nuanced filtering experience.

    Filter Evasion Detection: ProfanityGuard doesn't stop at the obvious. It actively detects attempts to circumvent the filter, providing an additional layer of protection against users trying to sneak inappropriate language past the system.

# Usage
Integrating ProfanityGuard into your projects is easy! Simply include the provided C++ files, and you'll have a reliable bad word filter at your disposal. Customize it according to your needs, and enjoy a cleaner and more wholesome interaction within your applications.

# For future updates
  1. Expand the black-list with more words
  2. Expand the white list with more words
  3. Improve the filtering, currently  the filter can simply be avoided if there is a whitespace in between the letters
  4. Make the filter noncase sensitive

# Contribution
Contributions are more than welcome! If you have ideas for improving the filter, enhancing its efficiency, or expanding its features, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request. The filter is not perfect, and I am aware of its many flaws but I am ready to be working on them. Any help is welcome!
